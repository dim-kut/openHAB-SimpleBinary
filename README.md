## Introduction

This binding for openHAB has ability to connect DIY devices (based on Arduino or other board with small MCU). Binding uses serial communication, so you can connect device with RS232, RS485 (multiple devices on one bus is supported) or USB (with virtual serial port driver). And also it is possible to configure several serial port not only one. 

Used protocol which is easy to implement. Implementation example for Arduino is part of repository. 

More about this can be found on wiki page: https://github.com/docbender/openHAB-SimpleBinary/wiki

Compiled binding is inserted into release branch: https://github.com/docbender/openHAB-SimpleBinary/releases

Binding is working with openHAB 1.8 as well as with openHAB2.
