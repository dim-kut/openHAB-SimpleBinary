The goal was to design binding with a simple protocol for exchanging data with DIY devices built on low power / low cost MCU (AVR/Arduino, Freescale, Ti MSP, ...). For this is ideal to use serial port communication with possibility to use RS232 or RS485 as well (multiple devices on one bus is huge advantage). For devices connected to ethernet possibility to use TCP/IP connection on the same protocol.
